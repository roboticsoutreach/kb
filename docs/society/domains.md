# Society Domains

We have some domains which are detailed here.

## `roboticsoutreach.org`

The registrar is CloudFlare (under the `sro@soton.ac.uk` account). The DNS provider is CloudFlare (again `sro@soton.ac.uk`).

## `sourcebots.co.uk`

This domain is registered at Hover. The owner is Andy Barrett-Sprott. We're planning on asking him to transfer this to our CloudFlare account.

## `robohack.co.uk`

This domain is registered at CloudFlare, but not in the SRO account. DNS is also provided by CloudFlare. The registrant is Alex Colville but he intends to transfer this domain to the SRO CloudFlare account soon.
