# University Room Bookings

## CLS Rooms

CLS Rooms can be booked through the [university booking system](https://roombooking.soton.ac.uk). You can book up to 12 weeks in one booking.

Our usual room is B32/3077 - the seminar room closest to the Hold.

## B53/4025

The Mountbatten L4 Seminar Room is sometimes used as a prep/setup room during Smallpeice.

It is bookable by contacting the Faculty Administrator via email.

You can also book this room through Outlook by making a calendar appointment and adding the room as the location. It will need to be approved by the Faculty Administrator.
