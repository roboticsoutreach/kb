# University Room Bookings

## CLS Rooms

CLS Rooms can be booked through the university booking system on [SUSSED](https://sussed.soton.ac.uk). Note that we can no longer book rooms after 6pm through this. It is currently not known how to book them out of hours.  Suggestion is to contact a staff member.

## B53/4025

The Mountbatten L4 Seminar Room is one of our usual locations.

It is bookable by contacting the Faculty Administrator via email.

You can also book this room through Outlook by making a calendar appointment and adding the room as the location. It will need to be approved by the Faculty Administrator.
