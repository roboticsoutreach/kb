# Storage

We own and control a large number of assets within the University.

These assets are split across three main locations.

## B32: "The Hold"

This is our main asset store.

Location: [Building 32][b32] Level 3, R3093 Airport Lounge North

There are three cupboards in this location. We have the two to the right-hand side.

### Access

The keys for these cupboards are held in the keysafe to the right, by the main door.

The code for the keysafe is controlled via the private Slack Channel `#cupboard-codes`.
