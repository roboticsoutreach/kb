# Radios

At some events it is useful to issue handheld radios to event staff and volunteers.

These are predominantly Motorola MOTOTRBO UHF radios (DP4801e, DP2400, DP1400, etc.) but (especially on analogue channels) other cheaper and more readily available radios can be used instead.

SUSU has a supply of Motorola DP1400 radios which can be hired out on request but cannot be reprogrammed to use the SRO codeplug.

## Licensing

In the UK it is required that the operator of the radio system holds a license. The cheapest licenses come in the form of UK Business Light and UK Suppliers Light licenses which allow usage of some shared frequencies across the entire country.

It should be ensured that a committee member holds the right license before radios on the below frequencies (apart from SUSU's) are used.

## Codeplug

There are several channels which are a mix of DMR encrypted and unencrypted channels and full analogue channels.

| Channel | Type and Details | Encryption | Frequency | License |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| SRO 1 | DMR (CC7 TS1) | MOTOTRBO Enhanced Privacy | 456.3875 | UK Suppliers Light |
| SRO 2 | DMR (CC9 TS2) | No | 456.9250 | UK Suppliers Light |
| SRO 3 | Analogue | No | 461.8875 | UK Suppliers Light |
| SRO 4 | Analogue | No | 458.8125 | UK Business Light |

At some events, SUSU channels are also used, which are not published here for obvious reasons.

### Encryption

Encryption keys for the channels using MOTOTRBO privacy are available from the Technical Officer.
