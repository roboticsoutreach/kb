## Technical Details

### Domain

Registered through Google Domains, in name of Dan Trickey (as I paid for it!).

Registered under the Screwthulu Gmail Account.

### DNS

Digitalocean DNS. Currently only under Dan's account, but under a DigitalOcean project group, so that others can be added.

### CMS

The website uses [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) as a CMS.

It currently uses the default `quark` theme.

Content is synchronised to [GitHub](https://github.com/roboticsoutreach/website) using the `GitSync` plugin.

### Hosting

Currently hosted by "mysterio", a Docker Swarm cluster owned by Dan.

Alternative hosting would need to be sorted before it is migrated away.
