# About Our Society

![SRO Logo](/img/sro_logo.svg)

Southampton Robotics Outreach (abbr. SRO) is a society at the [University of Southampton][uos] that aims to get young people involved in STEM through the medium of robotics.

## What do we do?

According to our [constitution](/society/constitution), our main objectives are:

- To share our excitement about engineering with others
- To introduce younger people to the range of activities involved in an engineering project including:
    - Teamwork
    - Planning
    - Technical Design
    - Technical Build
    - Testing
- To use the medium of robotics to inspire the next generation to take their involvement with engineeringto the next level
- To develop our own project management and technical engineering experience by leading others

## What do we **really** do?

So the rather bland descriptions above essentially boil down into the following activities:

- Run exciting events for young people, teaching them about programming and robotics
- An [annual summer school](/events/smallpeice) for year 12 students, where they have a week to design and build an autonomous robot to compete in a challenge.
- Develop industry-grade software and hardware to faciliate the above
- Social events - including board games, escape rooms, pub trips and more!
