# Timeline

This page aims to give an overview of all of the major tasks that need to be done during a summer school cycle. It should be added to and amended throughout each cycle to ensure that it is accurate.

Specific tasks are written in *italics*.

Rough dates are written in **bold**.

## Organisation

### Initial Planning

**October / November**

At this stage, we need to work out the organisation and details of the course so that it can be opened for registration.

#### Key Roles Allocation

**Time Unknown**

The key leads in each organisation need to be identified. SRO needs a point of contactP to manage discussions with ECS and keep track of tasks. ECS need to select an academic who will be in charge of the course from their end.

- *ECS to select academic lead*
- *SRO select primary organisational contact*
    - SRO usually have a team of people working on organising the summer school, but the University likes to have a name on their list.

#### Improvements

**Time Unknown**

Any major improvements that we want to make to the summer school following feedback from the previous year need to be identified.

- *Review Retro from previous year*
- *Review feedback from Smallpeice*

#### Budget Acquisition

**Time Unknown**

Food, accomodation and evening activities are funded and managed by Smallpeice. The funds required to run the daytime robotics activities come from ECS. In order for ECS to allocate the required fund, a draft budget is required. This can be based on the costs for the previous year + inflation (CPI - Consumer Price Index). Additional planning may be required if changes with new costs are planned (e.g major equipment manufacture).

- *Perform a rough inventory / inventory audit.*
- *Create and submit a draft budget to ECS*
- *ECS will confirm budget and provide cost codes.*

#### Course Definition

**Time Unknown**

The details of the course need to be confirmed between us, ECS and Smallpeice. In particular, we need to provide a description of the course that can be used to promote the course. We also need to confirm the maximum number of places available on the course. 

At the time of writing, the course description from the previous year could not be found.

- *Confirm the course definition*

#### Date Confirmation

**Time Unknown**

Proposed dates are usually suggested by Smallpeice after discussions with the university Hospitality and catering department. Before dates can be confirmed, there are several key resources that need to be booked.

- Zepler L2 Labs
- The Cube
- Bar 2 and other spaces in B42
- (Ideally) Large space near our primary storage - currently B53 / 4025

- *Book Labs*
- *Book SUSU*
- *Book rooms for logistics*
- *Confirm dates with Smallpeice*

### Later Stage Planning

**November - ???**

#### Computing Resources

**Time Unknown**

We need to ensure that the students on the course have sufficient access to the University's computing resources.

- *Confirm conference accounts* (usually done by ECS)
- *Borrow laptops.* (1 per team.)

#### Catering Confirmations

Whilst SRO do not handle most of the catering, it is important for us to check that it has been booked. We do need to book any breaks taking place in SUSU though, as this cannot be done though Hospitality.

- *Confirm break catering*
- *Confirm meal catering*
- *Book breaks with SUSU*

#### Call for Volunteers

**April**

After the dates have been confirmed, we can open volunteer sign-ups. This is usually done as an online form (Google Forms).

It is important to leave this late enough in the year so that students with summer internships know what they are doing.

There are various bits of information that we need to get from volunteers, many of which are sensitive and will need to be handled in accordance with GDPR.

The following is the minimum data that we need:

- Email Address
- Name (inc. Surname)
- Pronouns
- Date of Birth (No under 18s)
- Volunteer Availability
    - Usually done as tickboxes: Morning, Afternoon, Evening for the weekends before and after, as well as the week of the summer school.
- Do they wish to help before the main event?
- Parking?
- T-shirt size
    - Include No T-Shirt
- Dietary Requirements
- Accomodation requirements
- DBS Checked? (Not Required)
- Formal Meal attendance
- Data Protection Statement
- Acknowledgement of Payment (or lack thereof)

It is also recommended to collect:

- Volunteer Meal Attendance


It is important to get all volunteers to signup, so that we have the right names to give to Smallpeice for food.

#### Rules

**Date Unknown, ASAP**

The game for the event should be designed and agreed upon as early as possible in the cycle. It is blocked by few things (mostly kit capabilities), but feeds into arena design, as well as labs.

When designing the game, it is worth reading the [Game Design Desiderata](/events/smallpeice/game-design)

- *Open game idea submissions*
- *Hold discussion meeting*
- *Submit final idea*
- *Finalise Rules into formal document*
- *Prepare information for Rules Q&A*


#### Student Information Packs

**~1 month before**

About a month before the event Smallpeice send out the event information and several pieces of information need to be included in this pack.

- Week Schedule
- Invite Parents to Finals
- Any worksheets (usually Python)

This is mostly handled by ECS.

- *Book car parking for parents for finals*

#### Confirmations with Smallpeice

**~1-2 weeks before**

Around 1 - 2 weeks before the summer school, Smallpeice will contact us asking for confirmations on:

- Formal Meal Attendance
- Volunteer numbers
- Dietary Requirements
- Accomodation numbers and dates
