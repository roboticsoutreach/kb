title: Smallpeice 2021
---

Smallpeice 2021 was the first time we ran a hybrid competition - using both physical robots and a competition-ready simulator. This was due to the COVI19 pandemic, which prevented competitors from caming to Southampton, but did allow SourceBot volunteers to be physically present to run some real robots on competitors' behalf with a webcam feed.
These robots were called 'Forklift-bots' to match the theme during the competition, then became known as the '[Rub-bots](/kit/outreach/rub-bots)' afterwards.
