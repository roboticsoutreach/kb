title: Kit Software
---

This page is here to give some brief details on the current kit stack (as of 08/19).

There are 3 main in-house components to the kit software:

- [SourceOS](https://github.com/sourcebots/sourceos) - The underlying Debian 10 operating system and build infrastructure
- [RunUSB](https://github.com/sourcebots/runusb) - A daemon that runs robot code
- [sbot](https://github.com/sourcebots/sbot) - The client Python 3 libraries that students interact with.

Additionally, we make heavy use of the following:

- [j5](https://github.com/j5api/j5) - The framework used to build `sbot`.
- [USBMount](https://github.com/rbrito/usbmount) - Scripts to automount USB drives.
