# 2019 Manufacturing run

After SP2018, it was decided that we should expand the summer school. Due to this, and also having had boards fail since the 2017 run, it was decided that we should do a manufacturing run.

The goals for the manufacturing run were to get us to the following quantities of kit:

- 25 x SR v4 Power Board (9 existing working)
- 25 x SR v4 Motor Board (8 existing working)
- 25 x SR v4 Servo Board (new board)

## Manufacture

After the low yield rates of the 2017 run, along with lack of volunteers to manufacture in-house sustainably, we decided that we wanted to manufacture externally.

A [quote pack](https://github.com/sourcebots/kit-manufacture-2019/tree/master/quote-pack) was put together and sent out to a number of manufacturers.

The decision was made to go with Beta Layout at the manufacturer. Beta Layout ordered the parts for us also.

## Receiving the boards

The power and motor boards were received on the 23rd September 2019.

This manufacturing round is still in progress at the time of writing.
