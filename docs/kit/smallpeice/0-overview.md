# Smallpeice Kit Overview

The Smallpeice kit is the most complicated of all our robot kit. It's similar to [Student Robotics's kit](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/kit/), and is supplied to teams for the Smallpeice Computing, Robotics and Electronics Summer School as well as RoboHack. The [RUB-Bots](/kit/outreach/rub-bots), Smallpeice Bot and Ram-P are all built using the Smallpeice kit.

## Electronics
Every team at Smallpeice receives an 18L RUB containing the following equipment:

- 1 x Raspberry Pi 3 Model B/B+ with a [Pi Power HAT](https://github.com/sourcebots/Pi-Powerboard-hw)
- 1 x USB Memory Stick
- 1 x [Tool Kit](tools)
- 1 x [SR v4 Power Board](power-board)
- 1 x [SR v4 Motor Board](motor-board)
- 1 x SR v4 Servo Board
- 1 x Arduino Uno
- 1 x Logitech C270 Webcam
- 1 x 4-port Hama USB 2.0 Hub
- 3 x Micro USB 2.0 Cables
- 1 x USB 2.0 A to B Cable
- 2 x MFA 919D501 Motor Assemblies
- 4 x 3.81mm [Camcons](camcons)
- 5 x 5mm [Camcons](camcons)
- 4 x 7.5mm [Camcons](camcons)
- Thick red stranded wire
- Thick black stranded wire
- Thick stranded wire in other colours
- Thin red stranded wire
- Thin black stranded wire

Teams are also given a 2200mAh 35C 3S1P LiPo battery when a qualified volunteer deems it safe to do so.

When building their robot, teams can help themselves to:

- Servos (Parallax Standard Servo, Tower Pro SG5010 or Power HD 3001HD)
- Ultrasound Sensors (HC-SR04 with a [screw terminal adapter](https://github.com/roboticsoutreach/Ultrasound-sensor-adapter))
- IR LEDs & Photodiodes
- Any other sensors and actuators that might be available
- Wire
- Camcons
- Components from the Zepler L2 Electronics Lab's stock
- Anything else (within reason)

Extras of items in limited supply, like Motor Boards, should generally only be handed out if one breaks. If it wouldn't be possible to give every team an extra one, no team should be allowed an extra one.

## Mechanical Hardware

Up to and including Smallpeice 2023, teams built their robots entirely out of 8mm plywood. Starting with Smallpeice 2024, teams are given 6mm T/V-Slot 20x20mm aluminium extrusion to build their robots with; any plywood provided is now pre-cut. The following lengths are provided:

- 4 x 400mm
- 4 x 250mm
- 4 x 150mm

Teams can help themselves to the following:

- Wheels
- Caster Wheels
- Wood Screws
- Machine Screws
- Nuts
- Hinges
- L Brackets
- Aluminium L Channel
- Inside Corner Brackets (for aluminium extrusion)
- Threaded Rod
- Gaffer Tape
- Electrical Tape
- Cable Ties
- Chicken Wire
- PVC Pipe
- Pipe Fittings
- Pipe Lagging
- Velcro
