# Wheels

## Drive Wheels

The Smallpeice kit uses BaneBots T40 wheels as robots' main drive wheels. They feature a 1/2" hex hole, and are mounted to the motors using a BaneBots T40H-SM62 hub. We have 3 sizes:

- 2 7/8" x 0.4"
- 3 7/8" x 0.8"
- 4 7/8" x 0.8"

and 3 colours/hardnesses:

- Green (30A)
- Orange (40A)
- Blue (50A)

## Caster Wheels

There are 2 types of caster wheels in the Smallpeice kit. They are both metal ball casters. One ends in a bolt and is bolted down through a pre-drilled hole. The other has 2 screw holes.
