# SRO Knowledgebase

This is the SRO Knowledgebase, which can be [viewed here](https://kb.roboticsoutreach.org).

It is built using [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and should be as easy as writing Markdown.

It is published automagically using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages.

Want to build your own copy of the knowledgebase? Clone the repository and run this:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdocs build
mkdocs serve
```
